title: About Me
---

Hi! My name is Ivan and every day I love web technologies more and more. My passion for web development started about 10 years ago after I accidentally press F12 in my browser. And my life turned upside down. At that time, I discovered HTML and CSS. It helped me edit WordPress themes and build landing pages for my friends.

For the last year I have been actively studying web development to make it my profession. Increased knowledge of HTML and CSS, learned <a href="https://learn.javascript.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://ru.reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React</a> and some libraries that make work easier. This helped create several learning projects including this website with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gatsby</a>

I am constantly learning new things and it gives me pleasure. Glad that I have an interesting job to do!
