title: About Me

Hi! 
I'm Ivan. I love web technologies more and more every day. My passion for web development started near 10 years ago after I press F12 in my browser accidentally. And my life turned upside down. At that time, I discovered HTML and CSS. It helped me to edit WordPress themes and develop landing pages for my friends.

During the last year, I have been actively studying web development to realize my dream and to make it my profession. I increased knowledge of HTML and CSS, learned <a href="https://learn.javascript.ru/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://ru.reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React</a> and some libraries that make development easier. This helped me to create several pet projects, including this website, developed with Gatsby framework.
 
I am constantly learning new technologies, and it gives me pleasure. I'm glad that I have so interesting things to do.
